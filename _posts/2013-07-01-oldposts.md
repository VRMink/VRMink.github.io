I have previously blogged about technology, mostly guides on how to do things I had a hard time figuring out myself, or opinons on the latest break throughs. I never was much of a writer, so I write for the sake of fellow nerds more than anything else.

Lately I have been using gists, but they leave things to be desired.

#### Some of my gists are
[How to extract time from MongoDB ids] [1]

[Setting up a secure private webserver with NodeJS] [2]
